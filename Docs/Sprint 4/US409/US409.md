# US 409 -  As a Port staff given a Cargo Manifest, I wish to fill a dynamically reserved array in memory with all the container's information in its respective place.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

## 1.1. User Story Description

As Fleet Manager, I want to know which ship voyages – place and date of origin
and destination – had an occupancy rate below a certain threshold; by default, consider an
occupancy rate threshold of 66%. Only the trips already concluded are to be considered.



## 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The matrix array should be dynamically reserved in C, adjusting the size of the matrix array to the amount of handled data.
* **AC2:**  All the details of a container can be present in more than one file. As  such, define a struct that represents a container. Therefore, in the end,  you should have a matrix of structs.
* **AC3:** The data types chosen for each field of the struct should be adjusted to  the types of values they store. Memory usage should be kept to theminimum required. Also consider the order of fields that minimizes  memory consumption.
* **AC4:** The function should be developed in C.
