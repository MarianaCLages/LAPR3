# US 303 - Closest to all other places

## 1. Requirements Engineering

## 1.1. User Story Description

* As a Traffic manager I wish to know which places (cities or ports) are closest to
  all other places (closeness places).


## 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Return the n closeness locals by continent.
  
* **AC2:** The measure of proximity is calculated as the average of the shortest path
  length from the local to all other locals in the network.
